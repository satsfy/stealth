# Stealth

A privacy auditing tool for Bitcoin wallets.

Stealth analyzes wallet behavior using real-world blockchain heuristics and surfaces privacy risks that are often invisible to users.

## Why this matters

Bitcoin users often unknowingly leak sensitive information through common transaction patterns such as address reuse, input clustering, and change detection.

These leaks can:

- Expose wallet balances
- Link identities across transactions
- Reveal behavioral patterns over time
- Compromise the privacy of activists, journalists, and everyday users

While these heuristics are widely used in blockchain analysis, they are rarely accessible to the users themselves.

**Stealth makes these risks visible.**

Stealth aims to become a foundational privacy auditing layer for Bitcoin wallets and tools. By making privacy risks understandable and actionable, it helps users take control of their on-chain footprint before those leaks become irreversible.

## Status

Stealth is currently transitioning from a controlled regtest environment to real-world mainnet support.

The immediate focus is enabling analysis of real wallet data using a local Bitcoin node.

Stealth ships a Rust workspace with:

- `stealth-engine` (analysis engine)
- `stealth-model` (domain model types and interfaces)
- `stealth-api` (http api)
- `stealth-cli` (cli api)
- `stealth-bitcoincore` (Bitcoin Core RPC gateway adapter)

## Project Direction

Stealth is evolving into a modular privacy heuristics engine for Bitcoin.

The long-term goal is to:

- Provide a reusable analysis engine for wallet developers
- Integrate with tools like Bitcoin wallets and node-based clients
- Enable privacy-preserving analysis using a local Bitcoin node

The project is also moving towards a Rust-based core for performance and portability.

## What it does

Stealth takes a Bitcoin wallet descriptor as input and analyzes its transaction history (initially in controlled environments, moving towards full mainnet support).

The report includes:

- `findings`: confirmed privacy leaks with remediation guidance
- `warnings`: lower-confidence or contextual risk signals
- `stats`: transactions analyzed, addresses derived, and current UTXOs
- `summary`: total findings, total warnings, and a `clean` boolean

### Severity levels

| Level | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `LOW` | Weak or contextual signal; monitor behavior |
| `MEDIUM` | Meaningful privacy leakage under common heuristics |
| `HIGH` | Strong linkage/fingerprinting risk |
| `CRITICAL` | Very strong deanonymization signal requiring immediate mitigation |

## Vulnerabilities detected

Stealth currently runs **17 detectors** in `stealth-engine`.

| # | Type | Default severity | What it indicates |
|---|------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | `ADDRESS_REUSE` | HIGH | Same receive address used across multiple transactions |
| 2 | `CIOH` | HIGH - CRITICAL | Multi-input ownership linkage |
| 3 | `DUST` | MEDIUM - HIGH | Dust outputs received/spent |
| 4 | `DUST_SPENDING` | HIGH | Dust merged with normal inputs |
| 5 | `CHANGE_DETECTION` | MEDIUM | Identifiable change output patterns |
| 6 | `CONSOLIDATION` | MEDIUM | Consolidation transactions linking clusters |
| 7 | `SCRIPT_TYPE_MIXING` | HIGH | Mixed script types that fingerprint wallet behavior |
| 8 | `CLUSTER_MERGE` | HIGH | Previously separate clusters merged on-chain |
| 9 | `UTXO_AGE_SPREAD` | LOW | Broad age spread revealing timing behavior |
| 10 | `EXCHANGE_ORIGIN` | MEDIUM | Signals typical of exchange batch withdrawals |
| 11 | `TAINTED_UTXO_MERGE` | HIGH | Tainted and clean inputs merged |
| 12 | `BEHAVIORAL_FINGERPRINT` | MEDIUM | Repeating transaction patterns |
| 13 | `DUST_ATTACK` | CRITICAL | Coordinated dust-pattern behavior |
| 14 | `PEEL_CHAIN` | HIGH - CRITICAL | Repeated peeling flow across hops |
| 15 | `DETERMINISTIC_LINK` | HIGH | Deterministic input-output mapping |
| 16 | `UNNECESSARY_INPUT` | MEDIUM | Extra inputs increasing CIOH exposure |
| 17 | `TOXIC_CHANGE` | HIGH | Toxic change consolidation patterns |

### Warning types

| Type | Typical severity | Meaning |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `DORMANT_UTXOS` | LOW | Dormant/hoarded UTXO behavior |
| `DIRECT_TAINT` | HIGH | Funds directly received from known risky source |
| `DETERMINISTIC_LINK` | LOW | Appears as a low-risk ambiguity signal in some transactions |

## Detection taxonomy

The Rust detector source-of-truth is:

```
core/src/detect.rs
```

The report model and type names are defined in:

```
domain/src/types.rs
```

## Example risks detected

Stealth identifies real-world privacy issues such as:

- **Address reuse** → links transactions and balances
- **Common Input Ownership (CIOH)** → links multiple addresses to the same entity
- **Change detection** → reveals wallet structure
- **Dust attacks and spending patterns** → cluster linking
- **Script type mixing** → strong wallet fingerprinting
- **UTXO consolidation** → merges previously separate histories
- **Behavioral fingerprinting** → consistent transaction patterns over time

## Complete setup guide

### Prerequisites

| Dependency | Version | Required for |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Rust | `1.93.1+` | `core`, `api`, `cli`, tests |
| Bitcoin Core (`bitcoind`) | `29.0+` recommended | Local blockchain/RPC source |
| Node.js + Yarn | Optional | Frontend (`frontend/`) |

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stealth-bitcoin/stealth.git
cd stealth
cargo build
```

### 2. Configure Bitcoin Core RPC

Minimal `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`:

```ini
server=1
rpcuser=localuser
rpcpassword=localpass

[regtest]
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=18443
```

### 3. Start Bitcoin Core

Regtest example:

```bash
bitcoind -regtest -daemon
```

Mainnet example:

```bash
bitcoind -daemon
```

### 4. Start the API

```bash
cargo run --bin stealth-api
```

`stealth-api` auto-detects common local RPC ports and can use credentials from `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`, cookie file, or env vars.

### 5. Run a scan request

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:20899/api/wallet/scan' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"descriptor":"wpkh([f23f9fd2/84h/0h/0h]xpub.../0/*)"}' | jq
```

### 6. Run the CLI (optional)

```bash
cargo run --bin stealth-cli -- scan \
  --descriptor 'wpkh([f23f9fd2/84h/0h/0h]xpub.../0/*)' \
  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:18443 \
  --rpc-user localuser \
  --rpc-pass localpass \
  --format text
```

## How to use the frontend

1. Run and open the application
2. Paste a wallet descriptor (`wpkh(...)`, `tr(...)`, etc.)
3. Click **Analyze**
4. Review:
   - Findings and warnings
   - Severity levels
   - Structured explanations

## Roadmap

### Short term

- [x] Rewrite the analysis engine in Rust, replacing the current multi-language implementation
- [ ] Add support for analyzing real wallet data using a local Bitcoin node (mainnet)

### Medium term

- [ ] Enable integration with wallet ecosystems (e.g. BDK-based wallets)
- [ ] Expose the analysis engine as a reusable library

### Long term

- [ ] Enable external clients (e.g. wallets, tools like am-i-exposed)
- [ ] Integrate with Floresta

### Test Coverage

Stealth test coverage includes end-to-end api tests, integration tests using bitcoind regtest in core/ and additional unit tests.  

You may run tests with:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Privacy notice

Stealth follows a local-first approach.

It is designed to run on top of a user's own Bitcoin node, avoiding the need to share sensitive wallet data with third-party services or external APIs.

This ensures that wallet analysis can be performed without leaking addresses, descriptors, or behavioral patterns.
